[update if updating the abstract]

In today’s society, students are growing up with short attention spans, little motivation, and low productivity. Simultaneously, AI continues to take jobs from humans; in the future, as humans produce less, they may face poverty or unemployment. To address this problem, my research focuses on identifying gaps in the neurofeedback loop, a critical component of neurotherapy that can rehabilitate one’s productivity and attention levels, by analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) data from users’ brains. With current technology, EEG decoders (which interpret EEG signals and are required in the neurofeedback loop) lack the training data needed to adapt across multiple subjects or scenarios. Other researchers explore using Generative-Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate artificial EEG data, subsequently finding success in training decoders on augmented (a combination of synthetic and real) data. However, due to the complex, multidimensional nature of EEG data, many researchers have struggled to develop GANs that accurately represent these nuances. The goal of my project is to address this by creating a cascaded-GAN architecture that generates artificial EEG data; my application of this GAN leverages its “stacked” nature to progressively generate specific EEG dimensions, ensuring that the complex nature of EEG data is represented in the artificial data. Using the TorchEEG Python library and publicly available EEG datasets, I plan to create a four-step cascaded-GAN architecture that progressively constructs neural oscillations, spatial data, temporal data, and EEG artifacts. By creating this accurate artificial data, my research advances EEG decoder accuracy, making neurotherapy/neurofeedback tools needed to improve attention or production usable in many everyday scenarios.
